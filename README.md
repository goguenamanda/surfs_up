Based on this information, I was able to draw a few conclusions.
- Both June and December on average have similar temperatures, standing 74.9 and 71.0, respectively.
- The minimum temperatures between June and December have more variability, standing at 64.0 and 56.0, respectively.
- The standard deviation of temperatures for both June and December are high, standing at 3.26 and 3.75, respectively. 

## Summary
### Conclusions
In conclusion, there are not any major differences between the temperatures in June and December. On average, both tend to stay in the range of 71.0-74.9 degrees. Although their average temperatures are similar, December has a much lower minimum temperature than June. Although this analysis does not show many discrepancies between the month's temperatures, more analyses should be conducted to take into account weather conditions as this can greatly impact the prospect of business at the surf shop.

### Additional Analyses
In order to gain more insights about the weather in June and December, I would run further analyses. I would run an analysis that includes precipitation and cloudiness to paint a clearer picture of the weather. Even if it is warm outside, customers may not be visiting the shop if it is raining outside. In another query, I'd include windiness and wind speed, which can also greatly affect individuals' desire to go to the beach and visit the surf shop.
